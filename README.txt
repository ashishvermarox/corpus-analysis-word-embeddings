1. Create two folders Dataset and Output if not present.

2. Download word embeddings compressed files. Extract them and place model.txt and wiki-news-300d-1M.vec(Fasttext) in the respective folders below.
	Folder 														Link to download Word embeddings
	./Dataset/WebEmbeddings/6									http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/20/6.zip
	./Dataset/WebEmbeddings/8									http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/20/8.zip
	./Dataset/WebEmbeddings/20									http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/20/20.zip
	./Dataset/WebEmbeddings/26									http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/20/26.zip
	./Dataset/WebEmbeddings/27									http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/20/27.zip
	./Dataset/WebEmbeddings/75									http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/20/75.zip
	./Dataset/WebEmbeddings/Fatstext							https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-english/wiki-news-300d-1M.vec.zip
	
3. After placing word embeddings execute jupyter notebook. All the external libraries will downloaded via jupyter notebook using pip.

4. This assignment was done on Google Collab due to limited computing availability. Even with Collab some of the models were taking longer than 4 hours 
	to evaluate and eventually crashed the notebook. So set parameters accordingly.
